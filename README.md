# BiomeBundle ModPack Friendlier Version

This is a fork of BiomeBundle (https://github.com/BiomeBundle/BiomeBundle/) aimed at making it more
friendly for inclusions to modpacks.

Currently it does the following:
- Updates Water Level to Y=63 (ALPHA, lots of tuning left)
- Removed Ore Generation (use another mod for that or add modpack specific generation)

Plans:
- Finish the Water Level update, needs tuning in a two account, two computer setup to see side-by-side-by-s
- Add underground lava lakes at Y=10 like vanilla
- Look at cave generation and tune for more room between bedrock and ground
- Refactor for inheritance to allow for more modularity
